This app is an overhaul of a previous project I made a while back when I was learning the basics of vanilla JavaScript. I wanted to include that project in my portfolio but I felt like it doesn't represent what I can do today. So I decided to make a version 2 of that project, adding: transitions between screens, a better contact menu, the selected show's score and the link to watch it (if you click the title).I also changed the design so it behaves better across different screen sizes and looks better.
